### One where everyone meets in Jaipur.

The first year at IITK ended on a random weekend, entirely remotely, thanks to the pandemic. While zoom meets were the only means of interaction (sucks), we had other plans this sem break. Imagine being free to explore finally after 4 years of preparing for something which isn't even making sense at this point of time, this was it.
