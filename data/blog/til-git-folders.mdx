I am doing the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year and trying to maintain a repository of my solutions. On the 10th day, I created a folder containing the solutions for day 10, and pushed it on Github.

But to my surprise, I saw the randomly placed after day 1 and not day 9. Weird.

A bit of research on the internet showed that the folders are [lexicographically sorted](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51075465/7507184), in Github repositories.

Could've changed the filenames manually, but oh well.

```bash
$ for i in {1..9}; do mv -- day$i/ day$(printf '%02d\n' $i)/; done
```

Came up with this easy bash one liner and things worked fine.
