There has been a very interesting case highlighting how a backend system based on a functional language could outshine the object-oriented ones. The case can be found [here](https://twitter.com/gergelyorosz/status/1502947315279187979). 

**TL;DR -** Idempotency is a really essential component to consider while building backend systems.

Quick recap: Idempotency is a Web API design principle defined as the ability to apply the same operation multiple times without changing the result beyond the first try.

More on that [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077412/what-is-an-idempotent-operation) and [here](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/).
