This was a jump into a huge rabbit hole, and it turns out to no one's surprise, programming languages are weird. I was writing in a *certain language* and for setting up an action which would later be consuming my program, I needed to compile the program in cloud and again to no one's surprise, you cannot compile really huge binaries on third party cloud services.

  <summary>What could be the the solution?</summary>

  Rewrite everything in C.

But I am dumping some finds here which I found to be interesting so I will dump here:

- [This comparison, and it keeps on improving](https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/sizegame)
- [If you do end up following the suggestion above](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771905/how-to-decrease-the-size-of-generated-binaries)
- [Also, use objdump with caution if you follow the advice above](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46382482)

Might write a detailed blog about the same sometime later...
