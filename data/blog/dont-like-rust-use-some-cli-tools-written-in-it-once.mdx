This started with me finding a really fast `grep` statement, as I needed to go through a large filesystem (huge, actually) and find certain kinds of malicious files. Turned out with `ripgrep` it was just as easy as any standard `grep` statement, whereas, if I'd choose to go the standard `grep` route, it'd be some chained command with `awk` and a whole lot of _regex_.

Anyways, you can also get started the switch to using (and appreciating) Rust CLI tools, 10/10 recommended. Here's a list of some of the ones I've used and liked:

- `ripgrep` <- `grep`
- `fd` <- `find`
- `exa` <- `ls`
- `bat` <- `cat`
- `procs` <- `ps`
- `du-dust` <- `du`
- `hexyl` <- `hexdump`
- `hyperfine` <- `time`
- `tokei` <- `wc`
- `sd` <- `sed` (not so awesome yet though)
- `delta` <- `diff`
- `broot` <- `tree`
- `zoxide` <- `cd`
- `zoom` <- `less`
- `grex` <- For regex stuff

Would update this list as I find more.

Cheers!
