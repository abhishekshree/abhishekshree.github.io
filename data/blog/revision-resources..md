### What you would want to Revisit:

- [These questions](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/ayushk/esc101.php) and the [solutions](https://github.com/avik-pal/ESC101-lab-Y17/tree/master/ESC101%20Questions%20Y17%20Batch%20A)
- [Good Pointers stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M)
- Also for recursion, which is made a dp problem forcefully go throught the basics of [dp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk) (This course is beautiful)
- For linked lists

  - Problems based on reversing a list (inplace too)
  - Doubly linked list for arithmetic (add is easy, try to multiply)
  - Some arbitrary linked list problems (though the ones in lab were easy) but can be done from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-linked-list-interview-question/)
  - Weird but nice linked list implementation [here](<https://brilliant.org/wiki/linked-lists/#:~:text=Linked%20lists%20hold%20two%20main,Space%20%2D%20O(n)%20.>)

- Matrix problems ! (Easy but need practice) [[Resource]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matrix/)

Lab questions are repetitive most of the time based on similar ideas as in the Y17 lab resource(first point)

Good resources for CP in general:

- [Number theory](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c90633h1291397)
- [Graphs - 1](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/60717)
- [More Graphs](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/graph-representation/tutorial/)
- [DSA](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS21S1jm43igE57Ye_edwds_iL7ZOAG4)
- [BIBLE](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
- [Every possible book](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books.md)
- CP-3 Steven Halim
- [Quick review for contest [book]](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

These resources are probably enough to get started or even for a div 2C problem (experienced).
